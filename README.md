Homework assignments for the Building the Toolbelt of aâ€¨Junior Ruby on Rails developer class I took in 2014

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts 'There are 60 seconds in a minute'
puts 'There are 60 minutes in an hour'
puts 'There are 24 hours in a day'
puts 'There are 7 days in a week'
puts "There are #{60 * 60} seconds in an hour"
puts "There are #{60 * 60 * 24} in a day"
puts "There are #{60 * 60 * 24 * 7} in a week."
puts "That means when you turn 20, you've been alive for #{60 * 60 *24 * 7 *52 *20} seconds, and if you make it o 100 you will have lived  #{60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 52 * 100} seconds. Make them count."
